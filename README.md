# Word-Search
Code to find the solution to a word search puzzle

This code will provide the row and column number along with the direction of the word in the word matrix. The input file will have to contain both the word matrix and the words to search for. The word matrix in the input file should have one line for each row in the matrix. The words to search for should be seperated by an empty line from the matrix. 

An example input file is included here. The output for this input is as follows:
```
      ATTENTION :  [17, 16, 'Left']
           BOOK :  [18, 5, 'Left']
  CLARIFICATION :  [19, 16, 'Up']
